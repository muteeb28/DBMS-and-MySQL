## Introduction to Databases

### What is Data?

**Data** refers to the facts and statistics collected together for reference or analysis. It can be in various forms, such as text, numbers, images, and more.

## File Systems

### Early Methods

- **Registers**: Initially, people used to write data in physical registers.

### File-Based Systems

- **Introduction of Computers**: With the advent of computers, data storage evolved to file-based systems.
- **File Systems**: Similar to storing data in Word or Excel files. These files are stored on hard disks or hard drives.
- **Access**: Whenever data is needed, users can access the specific file.

### Challenges with File-Based Systems

1. **Data Redundancy**:
   - **Definition**: Having multiple copies of the same data, leading to wasted storage space.
   - **Example**: Each class teacher shares the top ten list with the in-charge. Both the teacher and the in-charge have the same data, leading to redundancy.

2. **Data Inconsistency**:
   - **Definition**: Different copies of the same data having different values.
   - **Example**: If a student's marks are updated by the class teacher but not by the in-charge, the data becomes inconsistent until both copies are synchronized.

3. **Difficult Data Access**:
   - **Definition**: Challenges in retrieving and managing data efficiently.

4. **Security Problems**:
   - **Definition**: Risks associated with unauthorized access and data breaches.

5. **Concurrent Access**:
   - **Definition**: Issues arising when multiple users try to access or modify the same data simultaneously.

## What is a Database?

A **database** is a collection of related data. Every piece of data in a database is interconnected.

- **Example**: A university database where student records, course information, and faculty details are all related.

## Benefits of Databases

- **Reduced Redundancy**: Data is stored once and can be used anywhere, eliminating duplicate copies.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that all users see the same data, reducing inconsistencies.
- **Easy Access**: Databases provide efficient ways to retrieve and manage data.
- **Improved Security**: Better control over data access and modifications.
- **Concurrency Control**: Mechanisms to handle simultaneous access by multiple users.
- **Easy Application Integration**: Databases can be easily integrated with various applications.

## Practical Example

### University Database

1. **Tables**:
   - **Students**: Stores student information.
   - **Courses**: Stores course details.
   - **Enrollments**: Tracks which students are enrolled in which courses.

2. **Relationships**:
   - **Primary Key**: Unique identifier for each record (e.g., StudentID in the Students table).
   - **Foreign Key**: Links tables together (e.g., CourseID in the Enrollments table references CourseID in the Courses table).
